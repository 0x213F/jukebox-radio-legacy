## Equity

### Eligibility

Contributions to the project will be awarded with fair equity. The project can
be described by the following definitions:

- An abstract concept and goal as defined by Joshua Schultheiss.
  - Goals can be explicitly defined as GitHub issues.
  - Goals can inferred by the direction and purpose of the project.
- Self contained inside of this GitHub repository.
- Superset of this GitHub repository.
- New ideas and directions provided from contributors.
  - Highly encouraged!
  - These are not guaranteed to be a part of the project.
  - These may not be eligible to be assigned equity.
  - Request written approval for a new feature to be eligible for equity.

If there are any concerns or ambiguities if the work you are completing are
eligible for equity, please ask Joshua Schultheiss for written confirmation.

You may ask for explicit actionable and verifiable tasks that will guarantee
that your work is eligible for equity. You may also create your own actionable
and verifiable tasks and have Joshua Schultheiss approve them to be eligible
for equity.

Any development completed outside of this remote repository is not eligible to
be awarded equity. For example, the following examples are not eligible to be
awarded equity:

- Local changes to the project not pushed to remote.
- Changes to the project that are on remote.

### Assignment

Equity percentage and contributions will not be calculated or assigned until an
arbitrary date solely determined by Joshua Schultheiss. It is likely (but not
guaranteed) that this date will occur around when the project starts generating
a significant amount of cash to cover legal fees and has achieved market
validation.

Equity may be assigned in the one or many of the following forms:

- Stock Award
- Stock Award Vesting Schedule
- Stock Options
- Stock Options Vesting Schedule
- Cash Award
- Cash Award Vesting Schedule

If you contribute to the project and demand an equity valuation, you will be
responsible for all lawyer and legal fees associated for determining equity.

### Transfer

Equity is non-transferrable.

### Liquidation

Equity may not have cash value.

identity and orientation.

### Standards
